<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Shaun — supply chain buyer by day, code learner by night, full-time dad all the time. I am based in Houston, Texas, where I have lived my whole life, eaten a truly heroic amount of food, and somehow survived the humidity. After years in logistics, I have decided to reroute my own path — turning toward tech, with an eye on software development and a heart set on growth.</p>

<p>These days, I am diving into code, devouring books, hitting the gym regularly, and asking big questions about what I believe and who I want to become. I am in the middle of a faith deconstruction journey — not because I lost something, but because I am searching for what is real and lasting. I have come to believe that knowledge — even when it is hard — is sacred. And I want to keep learning for as long as I am here.</p>

<p>People tend to describe me as even-keeled, loyal, and a good listener — the kind of person you can talk to while splitting a plate of tacos or spotting you at the bench press. If this site makes you want to connect, share, or simply be curious, then it is doing its job. Thank you for reading.</p>
